    "Alagesan and their colleagues aims to investigate the difference between heterotrophic and mixotrophic metabolism in Cupriavidus necator H16. They setup of three experimental condition differing in the available carbon sources. Two heterotrophic growth conditions using either [1-13C]fructose, or [1,2-13C]Glycerol as the sole carbon source and one mixotrophic condition using a mix of [1,2-13C]Glycerol and unlabelled CO2 as carbon source. All cultures are growth as batch cultures and samples were drawn during exponential growth phase."

    "These experiments utilizes different substrates. Thus, the model should not be able to import glycerol if it wasn't present in the medium. There are two ways to handle this situation. The first method is to remove the reactions that are known to be inactive. Here one should pay special attention to the \"source\" metabolites of the INCA model. INCA automatically determine which metabolites are \"sources\" and \"sinks\", if a metabolite is only consumed in reactions it is considered a \"source\". In this model the glycerol uptake goes through the following reactions:"

    "It is clear that some of these estimates e.g. Histidine338 M3, fits the data quite poor. There are different ways of handling poor fitting measurements. It this case it it likely that the poor fit arise from mistake that we made when formulating the model or the data. Because this data comes from another group, we may have missed some important details when reproducing the analysis. At the end we will shortly compare the our results the to results in figure 2 in the article. We will consider only the reactions around F6P as this is were the carbon which enters the cells is split between different metabolic pathways."
