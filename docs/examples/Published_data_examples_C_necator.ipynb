    "Alagesan and their colleagues aims to investigate the difference between heterotrophic and mixotrophic metabolism in Cupriavidus necator H16. They setup of three experimental condition differing in the available carbon sources. Two heterotrophic growth conditions using either [1-13C]fructose, or [1,2-13C]Glycerol as the sole carbon source and one mixotrophic condition using a mix of [1,2-13C]Glycerol and unlabelled CO2 as carbon source. All cultures are growth as batch cultures and samples were drawn during exponential growth phase."

If we want to do natural abundance correction through INCA we should also supply the chemical formula of all the unlabelled atoms of the fragment.
