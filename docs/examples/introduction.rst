Introduction
============

We provide example Jupyter notebooks for each of the incawrapper modules. These notebooks
represent different functionalities of incawrapper and can be used as templates for your own analysis.
If you have your data ready, you just have to adjust the paths and let the pre-written code
do the work for you. Please don't forget to give us a shout out! (I.e., please cite us)

If you have any questions, please contact the students currently working on incawrapper:
You can find their mail addresses on the biosustain website
